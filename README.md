# Cobra 🐍

> "Its so fast your grandma's Dell inspiron 530 can run it!" -- Hopefully Prof. Ronghui Gu one day 

This is the main source code repository for Cobra. It contains the compiler, standard library, and documentation.

## Quick Start

The following will clean output files along with compiling the executable to run against `calc.tb` which can contain any valid input conforming to the Cobra Spec.

```
make clean && make
```

The output generated (if successful) will be generated in `calc.out`.
